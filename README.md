# LearningReact

I'm learning React and Redux in a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview). This is where I'm saving my work. You can check out the various projects that I've done in the branches. So far there are:
- youtubeSearch: An app to allow for the searching, listing, and playing of Youtube videos
- reduxLearning: An app used to learn the basics of state management with Redux. Allows for viewing a book list and selecting a book for more info. Pretty simple.
- weatherApp: An app that allows the user to search for cities and see a simple 5 day weather forecast for all of them combined. Uses a public weather API and the Google Maps API to display the city location.
